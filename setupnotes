This is all super old.

== setting up new mac ==

1) Ran ~/dotfiles/macos - didn't like scrollbars everywhere

==== NVIM and Python3 ====
2) manual install of brew
3) brew install nvim.
4) manual install of vim-plug:
  curl -fLo  ~/.local/share/nvim/site/autoload/vim.plug --create-dirs     https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/vim-plug/master/plug.vim
5) pip3 install neovim
6) brew install zsh, bash
7) set python3 provider to be /usr/local/bin/python3
8) Set /Users/<adsfa>/to be accurate

==== Bash ====

add /usr/local/bin/bash to /etc/shells
chsh /usr/local/bin/bash

==== OH MY ZSH ====

Not fucking yet. I need to clean out that damn zshrc / antigen

==== Set up dotfiles and log locations

for i in aliases vimrc bash_profile bashrc; do ln -s ~/$i ~/.$i; done
FIX THE NVIMRC TO WHERE NVIM LIKES IT AND ALSO MAYBE FINALLY RECORD IT
mkdir ~/bin
mkdir ~/logs
set iTerm settings files to ~/dotfiles
set iTerm logfiles ....
set iTerm etc
(install dracula colors)
